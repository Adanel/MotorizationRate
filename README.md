# Motorization Rate

We have social and economic data on the inhabitants of French towns and want to predict the motorization rate.

We'll be using :
- a dataset with all the motorization rate for each city : https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/taux-de-motorisation-des-menages/
- a dataset with socio-economic insights concerning cities : https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/data-insee-sur-les-communes/

They are both on Open Licence.
